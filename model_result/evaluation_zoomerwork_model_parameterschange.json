        "response": "Quantum computing is a new way of computing that uses the principles of quantum mechanics, which are different from classical mechanics. In classical computing, information is processed using bits that can have either a 0 or a 1 value. In quantum computing, information is processed using quantum bits or qubits, which can have both a 0 and a 1 value at the same time. This allows quantum computers to process information much faster than classical computers. Quantum computing is still in its early stages, and there",
