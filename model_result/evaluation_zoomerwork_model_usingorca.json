        "response": "Quantum computing is a way of processing information using the principles of quantum mechanics. Unlike classical computing, which uses bits (0s and 1s) to represent information, quantum computing uses quantum bits, or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states at the same time, which allows them to process information more quickly and efficiently than classical bits. Quantum computers use these qubits to perform calculations that are too complex for classical computers to handle. The potential benefits of quantum computing include faster processing times,",
